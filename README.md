# MontyHall
Java Program that gives you an option between 3 doors to win a prize. Once you pick a door, one of the doors that is wrong is revealed and you have the choice to whether stay with your first choice or to switch your choice. My Monty Hall Program is a brain teaser that combines problem solving and probability. I Used JOptionPane to provide a GUI to interact with.
